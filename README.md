## Business Problem

As Atliq Hardwareâ€™s business grows rapidly, they still rely on Excel files for data analytics. However, Excel files are difficult to consume and are not effective in generating actionable insights. This lack of effective analytics has led to a major loss in the Latin American market.

Meanwhile, their main competitor, **Dell**, is experiencing substantial growth by making data-driven decisions, supported by a dedicated data analytics team. Atliq Hardware needs a more robust analytics solution to remain competitive and drive data-informed strategies.
